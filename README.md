# Polymorphic Virus Project

## Overview

This project implements a polymorphic virus designed to evade dynamic analysis by altering its signature each time it is executed. The primary goal of this virus is to showcase the concept of polymorphism in the context of computer security. The payload, for the purpose of this assignment, demonstrates a simple "Hello, World!" statement, but the technique can be adapted for more sophisticated exploits.

## Features

- **Polymorphic Nature:** The virus changes its signature dynamically, making it challenging for static analysis tools to detect and classify.
- **Payload:** The payload, though benign in this case, illustrates the potential for executing arbitrary code. Users can replace the payload with any desired exploit.
- **Encryption:** The virus encrypts its payload, requiring a password for decryption, adding an additional layer of obfuscation.

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/polymorphic-virus.git
    cd polymorphic-virus
    ```

2. **Execution:**
    - Execute the virus script, which will decrypt the payload and execute it.
    ```bash
    bash polymorphic_virus.sh
    ```

3. **Customization:**
    - Modify the payload in the `polymorphic_virus.sh` script to incorporate your own exploit.

4. **Important Notes:**
    - Use this project responsibly and only for educational purposes. Do not deploy or distribute this code maliciously.
    - Ensure compliance with ethical guidelines and legal regulations.

## Requirements

- **Bash:** The script is written in Bash and requires a compatible environment for execution.
- **OpenSSL:** Used for encryption and decryption.
